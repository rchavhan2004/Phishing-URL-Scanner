  <strong>🔒 A Secure Approach to File Encryption and Decryption</strong>
</p>

---

## ⚡ Overview

The **File Encryptor Project** is a simple yet powerful tool designed to demonstrate the principles of encryption and decryption using Python's `cryptography` library.

- ✅ Encrypt sensitive files securely.
- ✅ Decrypt encrypted files with ease.
- ✅ Learn the basics of file security and key management.

---

## 🛠 Features

- 🔑 **Key Generation** for secure encryption
- 📁 **File Encryption** using AES-based algorithms
- 🛡 **Secure Key Storage**
- 🔓 **File Decryption** with a provided key
- 🌍 **Cross-platform compatibility**

---

## 🧩 How It Works

### 🔐 Key Management

1. **Generate Key**: A unique encryption key is created using the `cryptography` library.
2. **Save Key**: The key is securely saved to a file for later use.

### 📁 File Encryption

1. **Input File**: Provide the file you want to encrypt.
2. **Output File**: The encrypted file is saved to the specified path.

### 🔓 File Decryption

1. **Encrypted File**: Provide the file to decrypt.
2. **Key**: Use the saved key to restore the file to its original form.
